# public ags scripts

Some small scripts I have created to make life easier at work.

How repos goes:
main: This is where finished features work
Experimental: This is where new features Should\* work
Branches with the name of a function: This is where features that Is currently being worked on lives

# How to use: 
It is expected to be run from a webserver. Put the Extras at the root of the web-server. Then make a folder with the contents of this repo.
You wil have to manualy edit all the scripts to pointing at your domain/ip address of webserver (I am working on making this automatic)
